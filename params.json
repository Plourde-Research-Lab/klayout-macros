Using Anaconda to create a py34 environment is pretty easy, and you can install the full Anaconda suite (with Numpy and Scipy) automatically. \r\n    - If you're running Anaconda with Python 2.7  \r\n    ```\r\n    conda create py34 anaconda\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* Clone this repository\r\n    ```\r\n    git clone https://github.com/calebjordan/klayout-macros\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n* In KLayout Macros Development Window (F5), right click in the list of python folders, and click 'Add Location'. Add the 'pymacros' folder. \r\n* Do the same for the rubymacros in the ruby tab. \r\n* In 'pymacros/Python Startup.py', change the path names to correspond to your py34 environment. For instance, \r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    sys.path.append(\"c:/Anaconda/envs/py34/lib\")\r\n    sys.path.append(\"c:/Anaconda/envs/py34/lib/site-packages\")\r\n    ```\r\n* Restart KLayout. Most functions should appear in 'Tools' menu. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
